This is my Personal File
I have included cordova-2.2.0 with this application.
In my Apps, i entered into Dashboard Page after using the credentials in the login page. After that, when i press the Back button in the mobile, it returns to the Login Page and not stay on the Dashboard Page. I have tried a lot.

But both onDeviceReady and onBackKeyDown not triggered :( â€“ Am i missing something???
